This is a small program that downloads and interprets some public data about exoplanets.

You can follow progress starting with this milestone: [Assignment](https://github.com/peterjhart/intragalactic-exoplanetary/milestone/1)

## To Install & Run

Open up a terminal and navigate to a directory you want to download the project into.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:peterjhart/intragalactic-exoplanetary.git
cd intragalactic-exoplanetary
npm install
npm start
```

## To Test

Once the app is downloaded and installed, running tests is simple:

```bash
npm run test
```

This runs the test in "watch" mode. Press Ctrl+C to cancel.

If the response in the terminal says, "No tests found to file changed since last commit,"
press 'a' to test everything.
